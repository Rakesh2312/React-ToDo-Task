## React Task App.

A complete task application with all features.

## Project Description

In the project, we will be creating a Complete Todo Application. We will do all the CRUD operations. We will use `React.js` and to manage our states, we will use `Redux`.

## Requirements

1. Functionalities:
   - Create a web application where users can add, edit, and delete tasks.
   - Each task should have a title and a checkbox to mark it as completed.
   - Provide a way to filter tasks (e.g., show all tasks, show only completed tasks, show only uncompleted tasks).
   - Form Validation

2. User Interface:
   - Design a simple and user-friendly interface for the application.
   - Use CSS for styling. You can also use a CSS framework like Bootstrap if you're comfortable with it.

3. Component Structure:
   - Create at least two React components: one for the task list and another for individual tasks.

4. State Management:
   - Use React's built-in state or a state management library like Redux to manage the state of tasks.

5. Functionality Details:
   - When a user adds a task, it should appear in the list with an unchecked checkbox.
   - The user should be able to mark a task as completed by checking the checkbox.
   - The user should be able to edit the title of a task.
   - The user should be able to delete a task.

6. Bonus:
   - Add local storage functionality so that tasks persist even after the page is refreshed.
   - Add animations or transitions for a smoother user experience.
